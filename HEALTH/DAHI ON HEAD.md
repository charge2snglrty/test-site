Research on milk-based products like *yogurt* highlights their potential benefits for hair health, primarily due to their rich nutritional content. Here are some key findings:

Nutritional Profile: Yogurt is rich in proteins, vitamins (like B5 and B12), and minerals (such as calcium and phosphorus), which are essential for maintaining healthy hair. These nutrients can strengthen hair strands and improve scalp health.

Moisturizing Properties: The lactic acid in yogurt helps exfoliate the scalp, removing dead skin cells and promoting a healthier environment for hair follicles. This can indirectly support hair growth.

Antimicrobial Effects: Yogurt contains probiotics that may help combat scalp infections and dandruff, which are common causes of hair fall.

Hair Growth Support: Proteins like casein and whey in milk-based products are vital for hair structure. They can help repair damaged hair and promote growth by nourishing the scalp.

While these benefits are promising, most studies focus on the general nutritional advantages of milk-based products rather than their direct effects on hair when applied topically. If you're interested in incorporating yogurt into your hair care routine, it can be a natural and gentle option, but combining it with other proven treatments might yield better results.
